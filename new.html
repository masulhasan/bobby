                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi, I am Bobby Cashman, a freelance graphic designer working between the UK, France, and Ireland. My design process blends creative thinking with precise, research-led art direction.</p>
                <p>I have worked as a Senior Designer at the Financial Times, one of the world’s leading news organizations, where I art-directed magazine covers, created digital ads, and branded new products and events.</p>
                <p>I also served as a Sales Enablement Designer at Gallagher, the third-largest insurance brokerage in the world. There, I discovered a love for working on highly technical, text-heavy documents like RFPs and annual reports.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about art and draw a lot of inspiration from music, video games, film, and fine art. When I am not at my computer, you will find me painting or drawing (or being annoyed that I am not painting or drawing).</p>
                <p>If you are interested in discussing a potential collaboration or just want a chat, let’s set up a call.</p>
